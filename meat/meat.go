// Package meat abridges a code diff down to the parts a senior reviewer
// actually needs to read.
//
// Reviewing good code in diff form is mostly about understanding the high-level
// change to the program, not sweating mechanical details: the code compiles and
// its tests pass. A reviewer does not need to read the exact spelling of an
// error message, an obvious zero value added to a return, the type conversions
// threaded through a field copy — or generated code. They need to know "what
// changed, where did it come from, where did it go".
//
// meat takes a whole unified diff (spanning as many files as it touches) and
// asks an LLM agent for an edit plan that removes noise while retaining what
// carries meaning. Meat applies the plan to the immutable input itself, so the
// model never authors the displayed diff wholesale. The agent has read-only
// access to the surrounding source tree so it can use clues to decide what is
// load-bearing. A diff too large for one agent context is split at file and
// hunk boundaries into independently valid chunks, abridged chunk by chunk,
// and merged (see chunk.go).
//
// The package is provider-agnostic: callers supply a Model. The command
// meat.dev ships built-in OpenAI Responses and Anthropic Messages models;
// embedders such as Shelley can still adapt their own LLM client.
